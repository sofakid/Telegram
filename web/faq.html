    <h1>Firegram FAQ</h1>
    What's the deal?
    <ul>
      <li>
        Firegram is an app for Amazon's Fire OS to use the Telegram messaging service.
      </li>
      <li>
        Firegram is a port of the official Telegram Android app, and is therefore Open Source, using the GPL v2 license.
      </li>
      <li>
        The GPL license grants you certain rights and you are encouraged to read the license.
      </li>
      <li>

    What's different with Firegram?
    <ul>
      <li>
        Telegram's official client makes use of Google Play Services to provide paypent processing, barcode and facial recognition, and mapping. This is not available on Amazon's Fire OS, so:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Firegram reimplements mapping using Amazon's mapping services.
          </li>
          <li>
            Payment processing and barcode/facial recognition functionality is unimplemented in Firegram.
